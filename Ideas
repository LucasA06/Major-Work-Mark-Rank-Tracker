Idea is to have a user-inputted database of previous assessment marks and ranks for certain tasks at school
Users can check using graphs whether they are improving in both marks and/or ranks
Potential cohort tracker? Dont know how to calculate this

Can add goals perhaps and see whether or not can meet them
Averages

Use customtkinter for nice look
Use matplotlib for graphing
Create and edit some kind of file to store information
